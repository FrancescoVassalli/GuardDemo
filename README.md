### What did we do? 

This repository takes all comments from [jippity.pro] (mock data provided) and checks them against llama-guard-3-8b using the Groq API for safety. Jippity is an AI powered kids coding tool where users create video games and share them with each other. Target users are 9-14 years old and play each others games on the website. Users can comment on each others projects therefore content moderation is paramount. Groq's speed is critical to the user experience because we do not want to delay publishing coments.
